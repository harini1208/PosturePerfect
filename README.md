Problem Statement:
To Develop a wearable device that monitors a user's posture using gyroscope and flex sensors with real-time feedback.

Solution: 
In today’s world, working with computers has become essential nothing functions without them. However, IT professionals and others who sit in front of computers for long hours often experience back pain and various health issues, leading to significant medical expenses. 

That’s why we believe in the motto: “Prevention is better than cure.”
Our idea? A simple yet smart solution, a wearable device built into a neckband, designed not just for function, but for everyday comfort. It looks and feels like a regular audio device you’d wear during meetings, but it does much more.

We use gyroscope and flex sensor with polyvinyl substrate embedded in neckband and monitor continously, if poor posture is detected we alert through audio feedback and also push notification in app.
 
Procedure:

1. First, we integrate a gyroscope into Bluetooth headphones, similar to how sensors are already embedded in wireless devices.

2. A Flex sensor is positioned on the back of the user’s body, powered and controlled through the headphones

3. The gyrsocope along with the flex sensor, now senses the bending and slouching position, continously sending the data to the PCB.

4. The firmware consists of the PCB connected with the database using bluetooth /wi-fi wirelessly

5. Together, the sensors and the fabricated PCB continuously monitor the user's posture using the database.

6. If poor posture is detected, the system provides voice alerts through the headphones and sends notifications via the app which we built.


Tools Used:

1. Android studio - To make app
2. KiCad - To design the PCB
